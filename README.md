This is a full stack's study project i've build using Spring Boot with Hibernate and JPA in the back-end, and vanilla Js in the front-end.

Entities/ Models: Products, Categories and Img (saving img as Multipart file in database);               
      Relationship: Categories to Products -> @ManyToOne;
                    Img to Products        -> @OneToOne;
                    
#Project overall description:
Index fetching product's data from the back-end api and rendering it.
All CRUD operations implemented.
